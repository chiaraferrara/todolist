# Todolist

A simple To-Do list application built with Angular and Firebase Firestore to manage your tasks.

The To-Do List Angular App is a web-based task management application that allows you to create, update, and delete tasks. It utilizes Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and manage your To-Do items.
